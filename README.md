<h1 align=center>shank1-nx</h1>

A native Nintendo Switch port of **Shank** (Klei Entertainment, Xbox Live Arcade, 2010). It is not an emulator:
the game's PowerPC code is statically recompiled to C++, and it draws through a native renderer on deko3d, the
Switch's own graphics API. It runs at 60 fps.

> [!NOTE]
> You need your own copy of the Xbox Live Arcade game: its content package from an Xbox 360
> (`Content/0000000000000000/58410A62/000D0000/`), or the game extracted from it. This repository and its releases
> contain no game data.

## How to install

<img width="240" height="224" alt="spider-man-tobey-maguire" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fa01c77-f0cd-49c1-a133-7a2308bfc8e1" />


1. Open the installer page: **https://zhtipu.github.io/shank1-nx-installer/**
2. Choose your game (its package file, the `58410A62` folder, or an extracted folder with `default.xex`) and press
   **Create shank1-nx.zip**. Everything runs in your browser and the game files never leave your computer: the page
   checks your copy, downloads the build and makes the shaders and the game pack from your files.
3. Extract `shank1-nx.zip` into `sdmc:/switch/`.
4. Start it:
   - **NSP (recommended):** install `shank1-nx-x.y.z.nsp` from the [latest release](https://github.com/zhtipu/shank1-nx/releases/latest)
     with your installer of choice and start **Shank** from the HOME Menu. The NSP holds only the program; it reads
     the game and its shaders from `/switch/shank1-nx/`.
   - **NRO:** start `shank1.nro` from the Homebrew Menu in title takeover mode (hold **R** while launching an
     installed game) or with a 39-bit forwarder. The album applet does not give the game enough memory.

Your `shank1-nx` folder:

```text
/switch/shank1-nx/
  shank1.nro
  LICENSES.txt
  deko3d_glsl.bin           (the game's shaders, made from your copy)
  deko3d_shaders.bin        (the shaders compiled for the console; written as you play)
  game_root.nxpack          (the files of your game, in one file)
  game_root.nxidx
  shank1.toml               (optional settings)
```

> [!CAUTION]
> The first time you play, the console compiles each shader the first time it is drawn, so new places can stutter for
> a moment. The compiled shaders are saved in `deko3d_shaders.bin` and later sessions start smoothly.

**Updating:** open the installer page again and press **Create shank1-nx-update.zip** (only the program and the
shaders), extract it over your folder, and install the new NSP if you use it.

## Controls

The Xbox 360 layout on the Switch buttons by position. Stick clicks are L3 / R3. The port's own menus are on
**L + R** with the D-pad (Up: performance overlay, Right: settings, Down: log console, Left: achievements).

## Known issues

- The cutscene movies' sound can stutter and drift from the picture at the console's stock CPU clock (1020 MHz). They
  play correctly with the CPU at 1785 MHz (for example a sys-clk profile for this title).
- The first visit to a new effect can stutter for a moment while its shader compiles (see above).
